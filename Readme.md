# Stock Utility
## 2019 WWU CS Hackathon Project

###### Authors: Matthew Lee and Timothy Poehlman


This project was born as a personal project of my (Matthew's) own which existed largely in the realm of fantasy. As per the rules of the event this project was written for, the small amount of code from the old version that did exist was not copied over.
 
 The main purpose of this program is to provide relevant stock market data (obtained through the Alpha Vantage API) and display it to the user. Additional functions include a crude prediction function that uses previous data over the past week, month, or year to guess what the price of a given stock will be at closing time on the next trading day.
