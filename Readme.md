# Stock Utility
## 2019 WWU CS Hackathon Project
###### Authors: Matthew Lee and Timothy Poehlman
This project was born as a personal project of my (Matthew's) own which existed largely in the realm of fantasy before this event. As per the rules of the event this project was written for, the (very) small amount of code from the old version that did exist was not copied over.

 The main purpose of this program is to provide relevant stock market data (obtained through the Alpha Vantage API) and display it to the user. Additional functions include a crude prediction function that uses previous data over the past week, month, or year (measured in closing data for each day, week, or month depending on the span of time to gather data over) to guess what the price of a given stock will be at closing time on the next trading day.
The user interface is console-only for the time being.
